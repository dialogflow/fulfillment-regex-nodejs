Choose one of the three options listed below for setup.  You only need to complete one of the three options below to setup this sample.

### Option 1: Add to Dialogflow (recommended)

### Option 2: Dialogflow Inline Editor
1. [Sign up for or sign into Dialogflow](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/#/login) and [create a agent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents#create_an_agent)
1. Go to your agent's settings and [Restore from zip](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents#export_and_import) using the `dialogflow-agent.zip` in this directory (Note: this will overwrite your existing agent)
1. [Enable the Cloud Function for Firebase inline editor](https://dialogflow.com/docs/fulfillment#cloud_functions_for_firebase)
1. Copy this code in `functions/index.js` the `index.js` file in the Dialogflow Cloud Function for Firebase inline editor.
1. Add `"dialogflow-fulfillment": "^0.5.0"` and `"actions-on-google": "^2.1.3"` to the `package.json` file's `dependencies` object in the Dialogflow Cloud Function for Firebase inline editor.
1. Click `Deploy`

### Option 3: Firebase CLI
1. [Sign up for or sign into Dialogflow](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/#/login) and [create a agent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents#create_an_agent)
1. Go to your agent's settings and [Restore from zip](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents#export_and_import) using the `dialogflow-agent.zip` in this directory (Note: this will overwrite your existing agent)
1. `cd` to the `functions` directory
1. Run `npm install`
1. Install the Firebase CLI by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`
1. Login to your Google account with `firebase login`
1. Add your project to the sample with `firebase use [project ID]` [find your project ID here](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents#settings)
1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions:dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment`
